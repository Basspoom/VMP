## Description

The **VMP (Virus Mining Pipeline)** is a modular and automated pipeline for mining viral genomes from raw microbiome data.
It integrates state-of-the-art tools for **quality control, assembly, viral contigs identification (our self-developed VPAC), clustering of viral genomes (vOTUs), and binning of microbial genomes (MAGs)**.
With its AI-empowered classifier VPAC, VMP provides both high accuracy and scalability across diverse microbiomes.


## Installation


### Clone the source code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Basspoom/VMP.git
cd VMP
```


### Create the conda environment

The VMP uses three separate Conda environments to manage dependencies effectively. The `environment` files are located in the `VMP/environments` directory.

```bash
conda env create -f environments/VMP.yml -n VMP
conda env create -f environments/VPAC-single.yml -n VPAC-single
conda env create -f environments/VPAC-dual.yml -n VPAC-dual
```


### Prepare required databases, VPAC models and the config file

The VMP relies on several external databases and pre-trained models. Please make sure to download and configure them before the first run. The dependencies of each module are summarized below:

1. **Quality Control**: Host decontamination database (e.g., human reference genome hg38).
2. **Assembly**: No external databases required.
3. **Viral Contig Identification**: 
 - VIBRANT database: https://github.com/AnantharamanLab/VIBRANT/blob/master/
 - CheckV database: https://pypi.com.cn/project/checkv/
 - Kaiju database: https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/kaiju/tree/master
 - geNomad database: https://github.com/apcamargo/genomad/
 - VPAC models: available via Zenodo https://zenodo.org/uploads/14033148  ***including single- and dual-path classifiers; Evo pre-trained models with path, model, and config***
4. **Clustering**: No external databases required.
5. **Binning**: No external databases required.

Users can run the script under the `VMP/database/` directory to automatically download and configure all required databases:
```bash
cd VMP/database
python prepare_database.py -db all
```

This script will fetch and set up all dependencies listed above.
- Estimated time: ~ xxx hours (depending on your network bandwidth).
- Disk space required: ~ xxx GB.
Typically, users only need to run this step once before the first use.


If some databases were already downloaded, users can specify only the missing ones. For example:
```bash
python prepare_database.py -db VirSorter2,CheckV,geNomad
```

After downloading, update the paths of databases in your VMP/config.yml file to ensure VMP can properly locate these databases and models, for example:
> ```yml
> paths:
>    VIBRANT_db: 'VMP/databases/VIBRANT_db'
>    CheckV_db: 'VMP/databases/CheckV_db'
>    Kaiju_db: '/your/path/to/Kaiju_db'
>    geNomad_db: '/your/path/to/geNomad_db'
>    VPAC_models: 'VMP/databases/VPAC_models'
> ```







## Quick Start

The GEM-PHI pipeline consists of three main scripts for feature calculation and one script for orchestration. All scripts are located in the `VMP/bin/` directory.

1. `calculate_node_features.py`: This script is the first step of the pipeline. It takes host and phage FASTA files as input and computes a variety of node-level features, including GC content, k-mer frequency, nucleotide transformer embeddings, and RBP embeddings for phages. This script must be run in the `GEM-PHI_nodes` Conda environment.

2. `calculate_edge_features.py`: The second step, this script calculates features for the edges connecting the nodes. It computes phage-phage, host-host, and phage-host edge features based on similarities and homologies. This script must be run in the `GEM-PHI_edges` Conda environment.

3. `final_inference.py`: This is the final step, which loads the pre-trained GEM-PHI model and the calculated node and edge features to predict phage-host interactions. The script outputs a list of predicted interactions and their confidence scores. This script must be run in the `GEM-PHI_inference` Conda environment.

For a complete and automated run of the entire pipeline, use the `run_all.py` script. It orchestrates the execution of the three sub-scripts in their respective Conda environments.


### Command Template
